* Cold and Warm app start time, see [App Start instrumentation](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation).
* Frozen and slow frame rendering, details can be found on the [Slow and Frozen Frames page](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames).

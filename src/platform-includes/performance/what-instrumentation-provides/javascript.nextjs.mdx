The `BrowserTracing` integration creates a new transaction for each page load and navigation event, and creates a child span for every `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` request that occurs while those transactions are open.
Additionally, the SDK creates transactions for all requests to API routes and [Next.js Data Fetchers](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview).
